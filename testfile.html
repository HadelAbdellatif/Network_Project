     <p style="color: #580257">A network is two or more computers (or other electronic devices) that are connected together, usually by cables or Wi-Fi.

Some computer networks will have a server. A server is a powerful computer that often acts as a central hub for services in a network, eg emails, internet access and file storage. Each computer connected to a server is called a client.

A computer that is not connected to a network is called a standalone computer.</p>
